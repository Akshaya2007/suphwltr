        My love,<br>
        I thank you for being there with me. Whenever I talk to you, I feel calmness inside me and my bad mood wears out listening your voice. I might have expected more than you could give and I'm very sorry for it. I'd have understood if it was any other time but due to not being able to talk to each other frequently, I was angry and I'm sorry for it.
        You suggested to take a break from relationship by pausing our love. However, I cannot take time away from communicating daily. I love you and always will. I just wanted to have a good talk with you. So, break isn't gonna do any good. 
        My mood is fresh now and I hope you understand it that break is going to be difficult for both of us. I'll cope with your behaviour and I promise I won't show my anger to you. Even if I do sometimes, please control my as you're the only one that can do it. 
        I still feel the same towards you as I felt previously. Taking a break makes me fear I'll lose you permanently and I can't do that. I'm also uncertain what a break brings. 
        I’m not comfortable with a break. It feels like losing you instead of fixing things. Let's work things out together and build something together. I hope you'll understand it. I love you babeeee❤️
        Forever yours❤️
