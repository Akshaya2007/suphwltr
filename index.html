        Dear Shruti❤️,<br>
        We're just 17. As teenagers, we obviously rushed in love. I should have proposed you after knowing you a bit better. I still don't know you to fullest. I think now that we took the right decision. We two were just the right person but the wrong time. 
        I've made some things as outline for me now and I hope you see it and like it. I'll give it below.
        1. Timlai board samma chai call mai as a friend padhauchhu. Timlai pani ramro hunchha malai pani ramro hunchha hai. I can do it without being disturbed.
        2. We'll stay as close friends. We'll get to know each other better. Kina bhane mero pida aile samma timle bujhekai chhau ani ajhai bujhchhau so as a friend ma kura share garchhu timlai tyo sundeu hai. Advice pani deu. Timro pani testo kei kura chha bhane bhana ma sunna always ready.
