        My love,<br>
        I guess you'd have enjoyed reading a hand written letter. So, I arranged this theme for this writing. Hope you'll like it.
        I'm so grateful to have you in my life. I feel so lucky. I love everything about you babeee. If you ask me what I like about you, I could list so many points.
        The one thing that I don't like is that you keep demotivating yourself and don't keep belief in you. A person with such a charming personality suit you to be demotivated. 
        I'm here if you need anything at anytime. Call me, text me, annoy me! I love it. 
        From simple text "Hello" to writing poems for you, from talking to going on a date, from calling to sitting together in bus, from holding hands to kissing on the lips, I've enjoyed every moment with you. I'm sure we'll create more memories.
        I'll be there to support you and help you. I'll always love you and be proud of you my love. Focus on yourself I'll always be beside you and will not turn my back on you. I won't every leave you or stop loving you.
        We'll build our future together. I promise to support you in your every step. You can freely reply on me. I'm proud of everything you've done so far and will still be forever.
        I love you babee! Hoping of forever with you mero mutuuu❤️
        ❤️
